# Flashcards Solo Project

## Project Description

This project creates a trivia game called Flashcards that is played in the `Terminal`. As the user, you will see a question, take a guess based on provided answers, and will be notified of the result before the next question is presented. After all of the questions have been answered, you are given a final percent score.
